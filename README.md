##Redbooth Android Test

We did an app a long time ago consuming the Marvel API, that displayed some cover pages in a list.
Unfortunately, after a lot of people working on it and no reviews at all, it's now legacy code. We
want to improve it's readability, and structure it in a way the can be easily grow in the future.
But we don't want it to become over engineered.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to fork this repository into your Github account,
and refactor the code (mainly MainActivity.java, but you are free to change any other file).
Once you have finished, invite users @akelael and @nescafemix to your repo, so they can code review
the result. For that, create a pull request (PR) from **your** work branch to **your** master
branch (please, don't create a PR to this repository). Then, we will proceed reviewing the same way
we do it at Redbooth.

BTW, the result must compile, but there's no need to make it sure that it works on a device. It
lacks public/private keys, and we don't need you go through the process of obtaining them. But
again, you are free to do what you want.

There's no time limit, but time is precious when you don't have a Tardis. We designed this exercise
so it shouldn't take more than 3 hours at most. But this is not a time restriction or a rule you
should follow. We want to be considerate with your time, so you don't have to spend a lot to show
what you know. If this exercise requires more time, it's probably because it wasn't that well
designed, so please, share any feedback about it with us :)

As always, should you or any of your I.M. Force be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow any
knowledge of your actions. This repository may self-destruct in five seconds. Good luck.
